cmac.gate_id_backends
=====================

Alternative dominant-scatterer classifiers for the CMAC ``gate_id`` field.

    radar_palette_available
    radar_palette_gate_id
    sounding_freezing_level
    build_classification_radar
    fold_to_cmac_categories

CMAC's own classifier is :func:`cmac.cmac_processing.do_my_fuzz`: five
trapezoidal membership classes scored additively, argmax per gate. This module
adds a second backend that delegates the classification to
``radar_palette.gateid``, an eleven-class scheme with its own noise-floor,
second-trip and despeckle logic, and folds its answer back onto the five
categories CMAC's downstream code consumes.

Why a fold rather than a wider ``gate_id``
------------------------------------------
Everything downstream of classification in :func:`cmac.cmac_radar.cmac` reads
the category vocabulary out of the field's ``notes`` attribute, and
:func:`cmac.gate_id.get_gate_id_categories` derives each category's integer
code from its *position* in that string. Two places also read codes as bare
literals: the Z-PHI phase-processing gate filter includes ``gate_id`` 1 and 2
(rain and snow). Widening the code space, or reordering it, would therefore
silently repoint those literals at different classes. So the published
``gate_id`` keeps CMAC's exact five-category order and the eleven-class result
is published alongside it, in full, as ``scatterer_classification`` with CF
``flag_values``/``flag_meanings``. Nothing downstream changes meaning; the
extra detail is additive.

The evidence guard
------------------
``radar_palette.gateid.single.classify`` decides which features a class may be
scored on by testing whether a feature *key* is present, not whether its value
at a given gate is finite (``single._budget``, and the ``available`` set built
in ``single.classify``). Gate temperature and height-over-freezing-level are
derived from gate geometry, so they are finite at every gate, including gates
where no moment was measured at all. An empty-sky gate can therefore score
above zero on temperature alone and be labelled ice or rain: on one BNF
C-SAPR2 volume 1,073,535 such gates were labelled, and on a NEXRAD surveillance
volume 8.4 million, nine times the validly labelled population.

In CMAC that is not a cosmetic problem. The ``gate_id`` field is the single
authoritative mask: it sets the gates used for velocity dealiasing, for the
Z-PHI attenuation and KDP path, and for all three rain-rate estimators. A
hydrometeor label on a gate with no measurement would propagate into a
rainfall total. This backend therefore requires at least one finite *measured*
moment at a gate before any hydrometeor label survives, and forces
``no_scatter`` elsewhere. The count of gates so demoted is reported in the
returned metadata as ``n_no_evidence``.

#: CMAC's five fuzzy categories, in the order :func:`cmac.cmac_processing.do_my_fuzz`
#: emits them, which is the order that fixes their integer codes. ``cmac()``

#: Default fold from ``radar_palette.gateid`` class names onto CMAC categories.
#:
#: The three rain intensities collapse to ``rain`` and the two frozen classes to
#: ``snow`` because that is the distinction CMAC's rain-rate and snow-rate gates
#: draw. ``biological`` and ``clutter`` fold to ``no_scatter``: CMAC's own
#: ``clutter`` category is code 5 and exists only when a ground-clutter field or
#: a vendor classification mask was supplied, so claiming it here would either
#: create a gap in the ``notes`` positions or duplicate a label. Both classes
#: remain readable in full in the ``scatterer_classification`` field, and both
#: are excluded from meteorological gates either way, which is what the fold is
#: for. ``unclassified`` means the classifier found no class scoring above zero,
#: which is the same operational statement as ``no_scatter``.

#: resolution is unambiguous. This is what keeps CMAC's per-radar
#: ``field_names`` configuration the single source of truth for field naming
#: instead of letting the classifier's own preference order pick fields -- which
#: on an ARM a1 file resolves to the ``uncorrected_*`` moments and would bypass

       preference list per moment and prefers the ``uncorrected_*`` names. On an
       ARM a1 volume those are present alongside the corrected ones, so the

       not had the per-radar ``ref_offset`` and ``zdr_offset`` applied -- while
       every other CMAC product uses the offset fields. Publishing exactly one
       candidate per moment, taken from the radar's own ``field_names`` config,
       removes the ambiguity.
    2. The sounding fill value is dropped (see ``_TEMPERATURE_FILL_FLOOR``).

    The returned object is a shallow copy: the geometry, instrument parameters
    and sweep metadata are shared with the caller's radar, and only ``fields``
    is replaced, so nothing here can perturb the volume being processed.
